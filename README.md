## Welcome to G-Epito's _github_ page

Besides developing both hardware and software for automotive test systems I have some side projects which are or aren't related to my daily occupation.

Currently I'm thinking about a distributed security system, consisting of solar powered sensor nodes and camera nodes with covert hub providing storage and access functionality.

Many more coming - when time permitting...
