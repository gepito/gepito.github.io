## Welcome to G-Epito's _github_ page

Besides developing both hardware and software for automotive test systems I have some side projects which are or aren't related to my daily occupation.

Currently I'm thinking about a distributed security system, consisting of solar powered sensor nodes and camera nodes with covert hub providing storage and access functionality.

I've been also inspired by spark eroding, when I've heard about not too long ago. It would be great to make some experiments with!

Many more coming - when time permitting...
