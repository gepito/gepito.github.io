## Welcome to G-Epito's _github_ page

Besides developing both hardware and software for automotive test systems I have some side projects which are or aren't related to my daily occupation.

Currently I'm thinking about a distributed security system, consisting of solar powered sensor nodes and camera nodes with covert hub providing storage and access functionality.

I've been also inspired by spark eroding, when I've heard about not too long ago. It would be great to make some experiments with!

I have some smal irrigation systems around me, so I may grow flowers at my weekend house's balkony  where I have souringly few time to be present. My experience is that there aren't reliable moisture sensors available - at least there are no affordable ones. This must be changed in the near future too :)


Many more coming - when time permitting...
